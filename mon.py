''' List of enemies '''
# ghost - ignores terrain
# sniper - fires from range (is this redundant with lasers?)
# cat - moves diagonally (single steps...?) (just worse mongoose?)
# thorn - stationary, damages adjacent (incl. enemies?) (terrain?)
# timed lasers - fire every n ticks along a line - (indicate firing path) - blocked by tail
# triggered laser - fire 1 turn after path is entered
# geysers - intermittently blow up in a point (or an area?)
# mud - takes two turns to move through
# fruit
